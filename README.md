# Royal match info

**Royal match info** is an [Openplanet](https://openplanet.dev/) plugin for [Trackmania 2020](https://www.trackmania.com/):

* Displays the **map names** when you join a Royal match
* Displays the **player and bot names** when a Royal match starts
* Adds a menu to **display or copy** the information listed above at any time during a Royal match

## Special thanks

Thanks to [jeFFeSS and his Royal Match Monitor plugin](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/royalmatchmonitor). I would not have been able to create *Royal match info* without this, as I had no experience with AngelScript, Openplanet API and Trackmania API.
