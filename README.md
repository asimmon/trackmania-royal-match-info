# Royal match info

**Royal match info** is an [Openplanet](https://openplanet.dev/) plugin for [Trackmania 2020](https://www.trackmania.com/).
When playing a Royal match, it displays a window where you can:

* See the **map names**
* Send the map names to the **global or team chat**
* Copy the map names to the **clipboard**
* Displays the **player and bot names**

Use the menu item `Plugins > Royal match info` to enable or disable the window.

## Special thanks

Thanks to [jeFFeSS and his Royal Match Monitor plugin](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/royalmatchmonitor). I would not have been able to create *Royal match info* without this, as I had no experience with AngelScript, Openplanet API and Trackmania API.
