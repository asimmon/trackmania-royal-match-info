# Royal match info

**Royal match info** is an [Openplanet](https://openplanet.dev/) plugin for [Trackmania 2020](https://www.trackmania.com/).
When playing a Royal match, it displays a window where you can:

* See the **map names**
* Send the map names to the **global or team chat**
* Copy the map names to the **clipboard**
* See the **player and bot names**

Use the menu item `Plugins > Royal match info` to enable or disable the window.
